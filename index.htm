    <br />
    <p class="indent">Ted wanted a tree seed. Mr. O'Hare didn't want people to have free oxygen, though. That is when the Once-Ler gave Ted a tree seed. Max and Mr. O'Hare fought alot throughout the end. Max won by planting the tree quickly.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">In the movie, Ted showed up alot. He really wanted that tree seed. In the book, he wasn't really eager to get the tree seed. He only showed up at the end of the book. It was him getting the seed.</p>
